# Implemented-Data-Structures
This is just some implementations of core Data Structures
written in Java. This was one interesting exercise where
i had to make implementations of HahsMap, List, Stack and
Queue. The goal was to create them just from scratch whitout
using the real ones. The first part was to make them with ints,
then with Generics.

## TODO:
Make the implementations which is the final task,
and redact the others -> (Add a function which doubles
the elements in the data structure when the number of
elements exceed the capacity of the current structure).
